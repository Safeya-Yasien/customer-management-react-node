# steps

1. create a new project using npm init
2. install express and mongoose
3. create a new file index.js
4. add typescript config
5. create a new file index.ts

# why i install express-validator

  but i use express-validator to validate the email and phone number instead of validation function which needs regular expression (RegExp)

# why unique email and phone not work
